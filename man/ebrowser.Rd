\usage{
ebrowser(meth, exprs, cdat, rdat, org, data.type = c(NA, "ma", "rseq"),
  norm.method = "quantile", de.method = "limma", gs, grn = NULL,
  perm = 1000, alpha = 0.05, beta = 1, comb = FALSE,
  browse = TRUE, nr.show = -1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{meth}{Enrichment analysis method.  See \code{\link{sbeaMethods}} and
\code{\link{nbeaMethods}} for currently supported enrichment analysis
methods.  See also \code{\link{sbea}} and \code{\link{nbea}} for details.}

\item{exprs}{Expression matrix.  A tab separated text file containing
*normalized* expression values on a *log* scale.  Columns =
samples/subjects; rows = features/probes/genes; NO headers, row or column
names.  Supported data types are log2 counts (microarray single-channel),
log2 ratios (microarray two-color), and log2-counts per million (RNA-seq
logCPMs).  See limma's user guide for definition and normalization of the
different data types.  Alternatively, this can be a
\code{\linkS4class{SummarizedExperiment}}, assuming the expression matrix in
the \code{\link{assays}} slot.}

\item{cdat}{Column (phenotype) data.  A tab separated text file containing annotation
information for the samples in either *two or three* columns.  NO headers,
row or column names.  The number of rows/samples in this file should match
the number of columns/samples of the expression matrix.  The 1st column is
reserved for the sample IDs; The 2nd column is reserved for a *BINARY* group
assignment.  Use '0' and '1' for unaffected (controls) and affected (cases)
sample class, respectively.  For paired samples or sample blocks a third
column is expected that defines the blocks.  If 'exprs' is a
\code{\linkS4class{SummarizedExperiment}}, the 'cdat' argument can be left
unspecified, which then expects group and optional block assignments in
respectively named columns 'GROUP' (mandatory) and 'BLOCK' (optional) in the
\code{\link{colData}} slot.}

\item{rdat}{Row (feature) data.  A tab separated text file containing annotation
information for the features.  Exactly *TWO* columns; 1st col = feature IDs;
2nd col = corresponding KEGG gene ID for each feature ID in 1st col; NO
headers, row or column names.  The number of rows/features in this file
should match the number of rows/features of the expression matrix.  If
'exprs' is a \code{\linkS4class{SummarizedExperiment}}, the 'rdat' argument
can be left unspecified, which then expects probe and corresponding Entrez
Gene IDs in respectively named columns 'PROBEID' and 'ENTREZID' in the
\code{\link{rowData}} slot.}

\item{org}{Organism under investigation in KEGG three letter code, e.g.
\sQuote{hsa} for \sQuote{Homo sapiens}.  See also
\code{\link{kegg.species.code}} to convert your organism of choice to KEGG
three letter code.}

\item{data.type}{Expression data type.  Use 'ma' for microarray and 'rseq'
for RNA-seq data.  If NA, data.type is automatically guessed.  If the
expression values in 'exprs' are decimal numbers they are assumed to be
microarray intensities.  Whole numbers are assumed to be RNA-seq read
counts.  Defaults to NA.}

\item{norm.method}{Determines whether and how the expression data should be
normalized.  For available microarray normalization methods see the man page
of the limma function \code{\link{normalizeBetweenArrays}}.  For available
RNA-seq normalization methods see the man page of the EDASeq function
\code{\link{betweenLaneNormalization}}.  Defaults to 'quantile', i.e.
normalization is carried out so that quantiles between arrays/lanes/samples
are equal.  Use 'none' to indicate that the data is already normalized and
should not be normalized by ebrowser.  See the man page of
\code{\link{normalize}} for details.}

\item{de.method}{Determines which method is used for per-gene differential
expression analysis. See the man page of \code{\link{deAna}} for details.
Defaults to 'limma', i.e. differential expression is calculated based on the
typical limma \code{\link{lmFit}} procedure.}

\item{gs}{Gene sets.  Either a list of gene sets (character vectors of gene
IDs) or a text file in GMT format storing all gene sets under investigation.}

\item{grn}{Gene regulatory network.  Either an absolute file path to a
tabular file or a character matrix with exactly *THREE* cols; 1st col = IDs
of regulating genes; 2nd col = corresponding regulated genes; 3rd col =
regulation effect; Use '+' and '-' for activation/inhibition.}

\item{perm}{Number of permutations of the sample group assignments. 
Defaults to 1000. Can also be an integer vector matching
the length of 'meth' to assign different numbers of permutations for
different methods.}

\item{alpha}{Statistical significance level. Defaults to 0.05.}

\item{beta}{Log2 fold change significance level. Defaults to 1 (2-fold).}

\item{comb}{Logical. Should results be combined if more then one enrichment
method is selected? Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{browse}{Logical. Should results be displayed in the browser for
interactive exploration? Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{nr.show}{Number of gene sets to show.  As default all statistical
significant gene sets are displayed.  Note that this only influences the
number of gene sets for which additional visualization will be provided
(typically only of interest for the top / signifcant gene sets).  Selected
enrichment methods and resulting flat gene set rankings still include the
complete number of gene sets under study.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed on to the individual building blocks.}
}
\value{
None, opens the browser to explore results.

The main HTML report and associated files are written to  
\code{configEBrowser("OUTDIR.DEFAULT")}. 
See \code{?configEBrowser} to change the location. 
If \code{browse=TRUE}, the HTML report will automatically be opened in  
the default browser.
}
\description{
This is the all-in-one wrapper function to perform the standard enrichment
analysis pipeline implemented in the EnrichmentBrowser package.
}
\details{
Given flat gene expression data, the data is read in and subsequently
subjected to chosen enrichment analysis methods.

The results from different methods can be combined and investigated in
detail in the default browser.
